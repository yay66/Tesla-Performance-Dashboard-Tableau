- Since the concept of electric cars has only emerged in recent years, and there is no existing dataset available for use in this project. Therefore, the dataset I collected for this project covers 2014 to 2022 and combines multiple data sources, including online databases and official reports. It includes quarterly sales figures, net profits, stock price changes, vehicle sales volume, market share, and the distribution of electric vehicle charging stations in the United States. After manual collection and basic data cleaning, I imported them into Tableau. The following is a detailed data sources introduction.
